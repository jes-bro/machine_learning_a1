    "# Module 1: Can Food Models have Bias? \n",
    "### _A rigorous evaluation of the impact of data on model performance_\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance can vary significantly with different groups or types of data, especially if a model has high bias. Models have bias in part because training data has bias, and training data has bias because people curate training data. A prerequisite to evaluating model bias is understanding how your model performs on different types of data. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of model performance, you can use established evaluation metrics. In this module, you will learn what those metrics are, how they work, and how to interpret them. \n",

    "Welcome to the first Assignment of Machine Learning! Pretend that you are the head of the R&D department for FoodNetwork (change to be more funny), which is a new FoodTech start-up that is aimed at helping members of the visually impaired and blind community gain more autonomy in dining (see https://www.jsr.org/hs/index.php/path/article/view/2341 for more information on this topic!) situations. As one of your first products, you are working on a Machine Learning-based approach to identifying foods in a given image. Three of your employees have developed their own classification models to accomplish this task (`model1`, `model2`, and `model3`) and you need to make a recommendation of if any of the three models are up to par with being released to your customers.\n",
