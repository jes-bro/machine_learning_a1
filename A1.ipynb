    "\n",
    "Model performance can vary significantly with different groups or types of data, especially if a model has high bias. Models have bias in part because training data has bias, and training data has bias because people curate training data. A prerequisite to evaluating model bias is understanding how your model performs on different types of data. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of model performance, you can use established evaluation metrics. In this assignment, you will learn what those metrics are, how they work, and how to interpret them. \n",
