# Machine Learning: Module 1 Assignment 1

This serves as the first assignment for Olin College's Machine Learning class. The assignment itself is contained within the A1.ipynb notebook. Everything else is utilitzed by that notebook and the assignment doesn't involve editing any of the other files in this repository. 

## Dependencies
Matplotlib, tensorflow, json and collections need to be installed. Additionally, python and jupyter notebook extensions must be installed in your VSCode environment. You can do this manually, or you can use the env.yml file we included here to set up the conda environment for you!

## Setup

You can set up your conda environment this way:

First, install conda ([Anaconda installation instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html)).

Then, clone this repo. After that, cd into it and run the following command:

```python
conda env create -f env.yml
```

After this, run

```python
conda activate ai_society
```

You're all set to use the A1.ipynb notebook!

## Usage 
The setup we used was VSCode with Python 3.8.18. Please use an interpreter for that version of Python as we haven't tested it with other versions. 

We ran the VSCode environment in a dual-booted Ubuntu 22.04 environment. You shouldn't need much compute to run this. Feel free to contact either developer of this code with any questions! 

## Module Information
This notebook is part of a mutli-week module in the Machine Learning course. Details about the module can be found [here](https://github.com/jes-bro/machine_learning_a1/blob/main/AI_Society_Final.pdf).
